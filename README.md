# TicTacToe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. 

### How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the game using the following command:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
4. The game will prompt each player to enter their move in the format `row,col`. For example, entering `1,3` will place the player's mark in the first row and third column.
5. Players take turns to make their moves. The game will continue until there is a winner or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
6. To exit the game at any time, type `exit`.

### Code Structure

- `TicTacToe.py`: Contains the `Board` class which implements the game logic, including methods to make a move, check for a winner, and reset the board.
- `main.py`: Contains the main game loop which handles user input and displays the game board.



### Requirements

- Python 3.12.7
